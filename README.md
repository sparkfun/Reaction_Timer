Reaction Timer
==================

(Project image coming soon)

The reaction timer is a simple tool to show how quickly it takes for a human to respond to a light turning on. When the game begins a large arcade button illuminates then starts a timer. When the user responds and hits the button the 7-segment display shows the user how many milliseconds passed. This is a great experiement for teaching kids about the delay between our brain and our actions (formally called [nerve conduction velocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity)).
